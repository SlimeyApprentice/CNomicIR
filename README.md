# NomiC Initial Ruleset
A C-based code nomic initial "ruleset."

## Explanation
Nomic is a game invented by Peter Suber to analyse self-amending systems, such as governments. Many internet communities have sprung up around this game, and have created quite complicated rulesets. Most of these communities (that I have seen) create laws that are meant to be read by humans. This is an attempt to have the law interpreted by a computer.
